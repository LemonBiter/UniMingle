## About UniMingle

Nowadays, many students chose to study abroad after graduating from high school to seek knowledge and enriching experiences that will contribute to their future careers. However, most international students will inevitably feel lonely when they arrive in Adelaide. Furthermore, because of culture differences, living habits and working patterns, students share most activities with their native speakers, which is not good for cultural exchange as well as life experience.

In order to encourage diversity, we propose to build an activity-based diversity online platform that provides opportunities to UoA students to mix with diverse cohorts and share their experiences. Students can propose a range of activities such as lunch meetings, barbecues, English corner, rock climbing, hotpot etc. All activities should pair students, one-to-one or in small teams such as they encourage local and international students to mix, as well as opportunities to mix between faculties or across year levels.
